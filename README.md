# 🧩 Unscrub

Welcome to the **official GitHub repository** for [Unscrub](https://unscrub.astrarune.com)!  
Unscrub was a fun little **web-based word game** where you tested your brainpower by unscrambling jumbled words.

## 🎮 How It Worked

1. Click the **Generate** button.  
2. You would have received a **jumbled word**.  
3. You had **five chances** to guess it correctly.  
4. If you were stuck, click **Show Answer**.  
5. Once the round ended (win or lose), a new word appeared!

It was simple, fast, and perfect for quick breaks or vocabulary practice!

## 🚫 Ads & Promotions

We believe ads ruin the fun.  
**Unscrub** was a **completely free** web game — made **for students and anyone who loved word games**, not for profit.

This project existed purely **for fun and creativity**, not commercialization. ✨

## 🛡️ Privacy & Data

Your privacy is important to us.  
**Unscrub did NOT:**
- Track your location  
- Collect personal data

You could have enjoyed the game safely, without worrying about ads, tracking, or data collection while it lasted.
