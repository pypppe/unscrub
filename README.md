# 🧩 Unscrub

Welcome to the **official GitHub repository** for [Unscrub](https://unscrub.astrarune.com)!  
Unscrub was a fun little **web-based word game** where you tested your brainpower by unscrambling jumbled words.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Click the **Generate** button.  
2. You’ll receive a **jumbled word**.  
3. You have **five chances** to guess it correctly.  
4. If you’re stuck, click **Show Answer**.  
5. Once the round ends (win or lose), a new word appears!

It was simple, fast, and perfect for quick breaks or vocabulary practice!

## 🚫 Ads & Promotions

We believe ads ruin the fun.  
**Unscrub** was a **completely free** web game — made **for students and anyone who loved word games**, not for profit.

This project existed purely **for fun and creativity**, not commercialization. ✨
