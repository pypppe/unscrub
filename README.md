# Unscrub

This is the official GitHub for the Unscrub web-game (https://unscrub.astrarune.com), Unscrub is a web-game where you click a button 'Generate', and it gives you a jumbled word, and you have five chances to guess it, if you don't know the word you press 'Show Answer'. If you do not guess it in the five chances, it shows the answer. And repeats the process.

# Ads & Promotions.

Advertisements and Promotions ruin Unscrub, Unsrcub is a free website for students & everyone to play for fun, this project was made for fun. Not to profit off.
