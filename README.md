This is the official GitHub for Unscrub. Unscrub is a puzzle game where you need to guess the jumbled word in under 5 attempts. If you do not guess the word in 5 attempts or press "I give up" the word will be given to you.
This is the only GitHub for Unscrub, we have nothing else about Unscrub except the site and this GitHub repo.
