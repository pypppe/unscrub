# ðŸ§© Unscrub

Welcome to the **official GitHub repository** for [Unscrub](https://unscrub.astrarune.com)!  
Unscrub is a fun little **web-based word game** where you test your brainpower by unscrambling jumbled words.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

1. Click the **Generate** button.  
2. Youâ€™ll receive a **jumbled word**.  
3. You have **five chances** to guess it correctly.  
4. If youâ€™re stuck, click **Show Answer**.  
5. Once the round ends (win or lose), a new word appears!

Itâ€™s simple, fast, and perfect for quick breaks or vocabulary practice!

## ðŸš« Ads & Promotions

We believe ads ruin the fun.  
**Unscrub** is a **completely free** web game â€” made **for students and anyone who loves word games**, not for profit.

This project exists purely **for fun and creativity**, not commercialization. âœ¨
