        <h1>Sunsetting Unscrub.</h1>

        <p>When I noticed, some buttons didnt work we tried to fix them, but that did more harm than good, this is what happened.</p>

        <h2>What happened before this?</h2>
        <p>Buttons such as Show Answer, and other buttons didn't work, which we tried to fix but ultimately failed.</p>

        <h2>Why did this happen?</h2>
        <p>After the Removal of the Show Answer button, pressing the “generate” didn't work, and we didn't bother to fix it, and now it's causing a sunset of the game.</p>

        <i>“We've all loved Unscrub, and so did I. It's sad to see it go, but more projects are on the way, you can play Emojiscrub on Mobile for free. Thank you for playing Unscrub, while it lasted. 💚”</i>
