        <h1>Removal of the Show Answer button.</h1>

        <p>Me, the developer of Unscrub & owner of Astrarune decided to remove the Show Answer button from Unscrub entirely, this is because the button was not working due to an update, and no matter how hard I tried to get it fixed, It ultimately never did.</p>

        <h2>How do I see the Answer?</h2>
        <p>Say a random word 5 times, such as a simple "a", because once you've guessed the word incorrectly 5 times, it'll show you the answer.</p>

        <h2>Is this Temporary?</h2>
        <p>Yes, I believe it may be temporary. But, who knows, it may never return.</p>

        <i>“We all loved the Show Answer button, and how it shaped the game, but it's sad that this button is now coming to an end due to a bug, We hope to see you soon.”</i>
